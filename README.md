**User Story:**

As a developer, I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1.**Application Structure:****

Given a text editor web application,
When I open my application in my editor,
Then I should see a client-server folder structure.

**2.Starting the Application:**

When I run npm run start from the root directory,
Then the application should start up the backend and serve the client.

**3.Bundling JavaScript Files:**

When I run the text editor application from my terminal,
Then I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.

**4.Generating Files with Webpack:**

When I run my webpack plugins,
Then I find that I have a generated HTML file, a service worker, and a manifest file.

**5.Using Next-Gen JavaScript:**

When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application,
Then I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.

**6.IndexedDB Integration:**

When I open the text editor,
Then I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.

**7.Saving Content:**

When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window,
Then I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.

**8.Retrieving Content:**

When I reopen the text editor after closing it,
Then I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from IndexedDB.

**9.Installing the Application:**

When I click on the Install button,
Then I download my web application as an icon on my desktop.

**10.Service Worker Registration:**

When I load my web application,
Then I should have a registered service worker using Workbox.

**11.Pre-Caching Static Assets:**

When I register a service worker,
Then I should have my static assets pre-cached upon loading, along with subsequent pages and static assets.

**12.Deployment to Render:**

When I deploy to Render,
Then I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
